NOTE: These makefiles are provided only for convenience.
Depending on the version of the compiler in use, you
may not be able to get the code to compile at all since
the POV-Ray v3.6 source needs a fairly C++ standards
compliant compiler and library/include file set. (It is for
that reason, for example, that Visual C++ v6 and earlier are
no longer supported). But if you could be able to make it work
with your favourite compiler, just let us know at
povray.unofficial.patches and provide necessary changes.

makefile.bcc - make of Borland C++  (www.borland.com)
makefile.gcc - make of MinGW        (www.mingw.org)
makefile.vc  - nmake of VisualC     (www.microsoft.com)
makefile.wat - wmake of Watcom      (www.openwatcom.org)
makefile.dms - smake of DigitalMars (www.digitalmars.com)

Those makefiles are supposed to be called from main POV-Ray 
source directory with path 'windows\makefiles' and optionally
with flags for including GUI (USE_GUI=0 or USE_GUI=1)
and performing debug build (BUILD=debug or BUILD=release).
Note that those switches influence name of subdirectory where
application will be builded so you can maintain debug and release,
console and GUI versions separately. Note also that GUI version
needs HtmlHelp header and library available. This differs between
compilers and sometimes needs additional tweaking and downloading
from www.microsoft.com.

Example of building with MinGW:

  make.exe -f windows\makefiles\makefile.gcc USE_GUI=0 BUILD=debug



AUTOMATION behind makefiles:

Provided makefiles were created with the help of Bakefile tool.
Bakefile specification for making them is provided in *.bkl files.
See bakefile.sf.net for more details.
