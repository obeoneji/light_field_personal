  "basis of any derivative works unless the file in question explicitly grants\n"
  "permission to do such.\n"
  "\n"
  "This licence does not grant any right of re-distribution or use in any manner\n"
  "other than the above. The Company has separate license documents that apply\n"

  "(or any earlier or later versions of those documents) unless:\n"

  "            direct or indirect) of any request or action of the abovementioned\n"
  "            party (or any of its products), any agent of that party (or any of\n"
